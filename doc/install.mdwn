etckeeper is available in git at `git://git.joeyh.name/etckeeper`, or
[in gitweb](http://git.joeyh.name/?p=etckeeper.git). 

It's packaged in Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.

Or, you can install it by hand. Before running 'make install', you
should edit etckeeper.conf and make sure it configured appropriately
for your distribution.

Distribution packagers may find it more convenient to set CONFFILE to point
to a different etckeeper.conf that is preconfigured for your distribution.
