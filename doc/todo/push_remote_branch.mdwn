Several people have written patches to extend `PUSH_REMOTE` to be able to
push a branch other than master. For example,
<https://github.com/joeyh/etckeeper/pull/26>

It seems that these are not fully flexible either. Maybe someone wants to
push 2 branches, or push different branches to different remotes.

I think that adding `PUSH_REMOTE` was a mistake. It would be better to
remove it, and add to the readme an example of writing your own
`/etc/etckeeper/commit.d/99push` script that does exactly the kind of
pushing you want. The only reason I've not done so is it would break
compatability for anyone using this feature. --[[Joey]]
