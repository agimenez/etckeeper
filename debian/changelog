etckeeper (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed to store all permissions of files and directories, even those
    with standard permissions of 644 and 755. This is unfortunately necessary
    in order to support etckeeper init on a checkout that was made with a
    nonstandard umask, in which case the files that were expected to be
    644 and 755, won't be. Closes: #649701
    Thanks to Дмитрий Матросов for reporting the bug and developing
    a fixup script (attached to the bug) which could be used if you've
    already encountered this problem.
  * Bugfix for filenames containing single quotes.
  * Use git add -A, which automatically removes deleted files,
    and avoids a separate call to git add -u.
    Thanks to Miklos Vajna, whose patch in 2008 was deferred
    because -A was then too new, and languished in a branch until found today.
  * Optimised metadata storage.
  * cron.daily: Don't stop committing when a stale packagelist.pre-install
    file exists.

  * Ignore -m switch to etckeeper commit, in case someone tries to use
    it with that option common to several VCS. Closes: #592050
  * Remove HOME setting in etckeeper. sudo now defaults to setting HOME
    itself as of version 1.7.4p4, so it is not necessary for etckeeper
    to work around its behavior anymore. (sudo also allows disabling that

  * Drop the debconf prompt before committing in pre-install.
    Closes: #470577, #462161, #471157, #462161
  * Stop using metastore, instead add shell commands to .etckeeper
    to handle permissions. Patch by Scott Bronson. The main advantages
    of this approach are:
    - .etckeeper uses less disk space than .metadata.
    - Git diff includes changes to the commands in the file, which is more
      transparent than a change to the binary .metadata file, and does not
      produce conflicts during merging.
    - Revision control directories such as .hg are filtered out.
      Closes: #471371
    Note that repositories still including .metadata files will be
    automatically transitioned, and the file removed. Also, etckeeper init
    on a historical version of a repository that still contains .metadata
    will use it, if metastore is installed.
  * Keep track of what packages change state during an installation,

etckeeper (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert the directory parameter of etckeeper into "-d directory".
  * Pass other patameters on from etckeeper to the .d scripts.
  * Stop using run-parts for various reasons.
  * Split out a commit.d that contains committing code that's used by
    both the pre-install.d and post-install.d scripts.
  * Split out an unclean.d that tests if the WC contains uncommitted
    changes.
  * Don't commit in post-install.d if there are no uncommitted changes.
  * German debconf translation. Closes: #460940, #458751
  * Use git status instead of git-status (missed this one before).

etckeeper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Separate debconf use from the main flow of the script so the commit
    stage can use editors etc. Closes: #459547
  * Remove the hint about setting -e to get interactive commits, since
    I don't want to encourage users to do that. (For one thing, it's unlikely
    to work if a graphical package manager is used..)

etckeeper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Added configuration options for highlevel and lowlevel package managers
    in etckeeper.conf.
  * Only install apt hooks if apt is used.
  * Only add backup conffile exclusion to gitignore if dpkg is used.

    to be used for other package managers.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Commit removed files in the pre-install hook to git, as was already done
    for hg. Avoided changing the debconf template so bubulle doesn't murder
    me; the current wording is just vague enough to still work with the
    current behavior.
