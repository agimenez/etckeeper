yum pre and post install hook, this is similar to the apt get hook.
its probably not as refined.

there is a simple spec file and makefile for generating installable
rpms. it also relies on the etckeeper package that I cooked up.

i've been using it on my own systems and it appears to work fine with
the autoupdate system and when i install/remove apps with yum.
